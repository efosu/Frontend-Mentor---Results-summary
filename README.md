## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Using fetch api to get data.



```js
fetch('./data.json')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(body => JSON.parse(body))
    .then((data) => {
    const cat_number = data.length;
    if (cat_number == 0) {
        summary_div.textContent = "No category to display";
        summary_div.classList.add('summary_empty');
    }
    else {
        summary_div.classList.remove('summary_empty');
        data.forEach((div => summary_div.appendChild(create_category_div(div))));
    }
    ave_span.textContent = get_average(data);
}).catch(() => {
    summary_div.textContent = "No category to display";
    summary_div.classList.add('summary_empty');
});
```


### Continued development
